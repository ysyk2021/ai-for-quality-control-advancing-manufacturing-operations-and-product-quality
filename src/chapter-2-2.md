Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing technology that has the potential to revolutionize quality control processes in manufacturing operations. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of AI for quality control and discuss the different types of AI used in manufacturing.

What is AI for Quality Control?
-------------------------------

AI for quality control involves the use of machine learning algorithms and other AI techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of quality control processes. AI can be used to analyze data from production lines, identify defects in products, and predict future trends.

By using AI, organizations can improve the quality of their products, reduce scrap and waste, and increase production efficiency. The types of AI used for quality control vary depending on the specific needs of the organization and the quality control process.

Types of AI Used for Quality Control in Manufacturing
-----------------------------------------------------

The following are some of the types of AI used for quality control in manufacturing:

### Machine Learning

Machine learning involves the use of algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions based on that data. Machine learning can be used to analyze production data and identify patterns that may indicate issues with product quality.

### Computer Vision

Computer vision involves the use of algorithms that can interpret visual data, such as images and videos. In quality control, computer vision can be used to identify defects in products by analyzing images taken during the production process.

### Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing involves the use of algorithms that can interpret human language. In quality control, natural language processing can be used to analyze customer feedback and identify issues with product quality.

### Predictive Analytics

Predictive analytics involves the use of algorithms that can forecast future trends based on historical data. In quality control, predictive analytics can be used to identify potential issues with product quality before they occur.

### Robotic Process Automation

Robotic process automation involves the use of software robots that can perform repetitive tasks automatically. In quality control, robotic process automation can be used to automate inspection processes and increase efficiency.
