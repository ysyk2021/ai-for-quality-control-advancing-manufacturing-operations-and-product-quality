# AI for Quality Control: Advancing Manufacturing Operations and Product Quality

# Introduction

Quality control is an essential component of modern manufacturing operations that ensures products meet or exceed customer expectations. Over the years, various methods have been used to detect defects and prevent them from occurring in manufacturing processes. However, with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), new opportunities for advancing quality control in manufacturing have emerged.

AI has the potential to revolutionize quality control by automating repetitive tasks, identifying patterns in complex data, and predicting potential issues before they occur. This book, "AI for Quality Control: Advancing Manufacturing Operations and Product Quality," explores the applications of AI in quality control and provides practical guidance for implementing AI in manufacturing operations.

The book is divided into several chapters that cover different aspects of AI for quality control, including defect detection and prevention, resource allocation and planning, ethics and governance, and legal and regulatory considerations. Each chapter provides an overview of the relevant concepts, best practices, and case studies that illustrate successful AI implementations in quality control.

By reading this book, you will gain a deeper understanding of how AI can be applied to quality control in manufacturing operations, and learn strategies for implementing AI in your own organization. Whether you are a quality control professional, a manufacturing manager, or a researcher interested in the intersection of AI and quality control, this book provides valuable insights and practical guidance for leveraging AI to improve product quality and optimize manufacturing operations.
